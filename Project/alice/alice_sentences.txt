CHAPTER
Down Rabbit Hole Alice beginning get very tired sitting by sister bank having nothing do once or twice peeped into book sister reading but no pictures or conversations what use book thought Alice without pictures or conversations So considering own mind well could for hot day made feel very sleepy stupid whether pleasure making daisy chain would worth trouble getting up picking daisies when suddenly White Rabbit pink eyes ran close by
There nothing very remarkable that nor did Alice think very much out way hear Rabbit say itself Oh dear Oh dear shall late when thought over afterwards occurred that ought wondered this but time all seemed quite natural but when Rabbit actually took watch out its waistcoat pocket looked then hurried Alice started feet for flashed across mind that never before seen rabbit either waistcoat pocket or watch take out burning curiosity ran across field after fortunately just time see pop down large rabbit hole under hedge
In another moment down went Alice after never once considering how world get out again
rabbit hole went straight like tunnel for some way then dipped suddenly down suddenly that Alice not moment think about stopping herself before found herself falling down very deep well
Either well very deep or fell very slowly for plenty time went down look about wonder what going happen next
First tried look down make out what coming but too dark see anything then looked sides well noticed that they were filled cupboards book shelves here there saw maps pictures hung upon pegs
took down jar from one shelves passed labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but great disappointment empty did not like drop jar for fear killing somebody underneath managed put into one cupboards fell past
Well thought Alice herself after such fall this shall think nothing tumbling down stairs How brave theyll all think me home Why wouldnt say anything about even if fell off top house Which very likely true
Down down down
Would fall never come an end wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time said aloud
must getting somewhere near centre earth
Let me see that would four thousand miles down think for see Alice learnt several things this sort lessons schoolroom though this not very good opportunity for showing off knowledge there no one listen still good practice say over yes thats about right distancebut then wonder what Latitude or Longitude Ive got Alice no idea what Latitude or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words say
Presently began again
wonder if shall fall right through earth How funny itll seem come out among people that walk their heads downward Antipathies think rather glad there no one listening this time didnt sound all right word but shall ask them what name country know
Please Maam this New Zealand or Australia tried curtsey spokefancy curtseying youre falling through air Do think could manage And what an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking No itll never do ask perhaps shall see written up somewhere
Down down down
There nothing else do Alice soon began talking again
Dinahll miss me very much night should think Dinah cat
hope theyll remember saucer milk tea time
Dinah my dear wish were down here me There are no mice air Im afraid but might catch bat thats very like mouse know
But do cats eat bats wonder And here Alice began get rather sleepy went saying herself dreamy sort way Do cats eat bats Do cats eat bats sometimes Do bats eat cats for see couldnt answer either question didnt much matter which way put
felt that dozing off just begun dream that walking hand hand Dinah saying very earnestly Now Dinah tell me truth did ever eat bat when suddenly thump thump down came upon heap sticks dry leaves fall over
Alice not bit hurt jumped up feet moment looked up but all dark overhead before another long passage White Rabbit still sight hurrying down
There not moment lost away went Alice like wind just time hear say turned corner Oh my ears whiskers how late its getting close behind when turned corner but Rabbit no longer seen found herself long low hall which lit up by row lamps hanging from roof
There were doors all round hall but they were all locked when Alice been all way down one side up other trying every door walked sadly down middle wondering how ever get out again
Suddenly came upon little three legged table all made solid glass there nothing except tiny golden key Alices first thought that might belong one doors hall but alas either locks were too large or key too small but any rate would not open any them
However second time round came upon low curtain not noticed before behind little door about fifteen inches high tried little golden key lock great delight fitted Alice opened door found that led into small passage not much larger than rat hole knelt down looked along passage into loveliest garden ever saw
How longed get out that dark hall wander about among those beds bright flowers those cool fountains but could not even get head through doorway even if my head would go through thought poor Alice would very little use without my shoulders
Oh how wish could shut up like telescope think could if only knew how begin
For see many out way things happened lately that Alice begun think that very few things indeed were really impossible
There seemed no use waiting by little door went back table half hoping might find another key or any rate book rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time found little bottle which certainly not here before said Alice round neck bottle paper label words DRINK ME beautifully printed large letters
all very well say Drink me but wise little Alice not going do that hurry
No Ill look first said see whether its marked â€˜poison or not for read several nice little histories about children who got burnt eaten up by wild beasts other unpleasant things all because they would not remember simple rules their friends taught them such that red hot poker will burn if hold too long that if cut your finger very deeply knife usually bleeds never forgotten that if drink much from bottle marked poison almost certain disagree sooner or later
However this bottle not marked poison Alice ventured taste finding very nice fact sort mixed flavour cherry tart custard pine apple roast turkey toffee hot buttered toast very soon finished off
What curious feeling said Alice must shutting up like telescope
And indeed now only ten inches high face brightened up thought that now right size for going through little door into that lovely garden
First however waited for few minutes see if going shrink any further felt little nervous about this for might end know said Alice herself my going out altogether like candle
wonder what should like then And tried fancy what flame candle like after candle blown out for could not remember ever having seen such thing
After while finding that nothing more happened decided going into garden once but alas for poor Alice when got door found forgotten little golden key when went back table for found could not possibly reach could see quite plainly through glass tried best climb up one legs table but too slippery when tired herself out trying poor little thing sat down cried
Come theres no use crying like that said Alice herself rather sharply advise leave off this minute generally gave herself very good advice though very seldom followed sometimes scolded herself severely bring tears into eyes once remembered trying box own ears for having cheated herself game croquet playing against herself for this curious child very fond pretending two people
But its no use now thought poor Alice pretend two people Why theres hardly enough me left make one respectable person Soon eye fell little glass box that lying under table opened found very small cake which words EAT ME were beautifully marked currants
Well Ill eat said Alice if makes me grow larger can reach key if makes me grow smaller can creep under door either way Ill get into garden dont care which happens ate little bit said anxiously herself Which way Which way holding hand top head feel which way growing quite surprised find that remained same size sure this generally happens when one eats cake but Alice got much into way expecting nothing but out way things happen that seemed quite dull stupid for life go common way
So set work very soon finished off cake
CHAPTER II
Pool Tears Curiouser curiouser cried Alice much surprised that for moment quite forgot how speak good English now Im opening out like largest telescope that ever Good bye feet for when looked down feet they seemed almost out sight they were getting far off
Oh my poor little feet wonder who will put your shoes stockings for now dears Im sure shant able shall great deal too far off trouble myself about must manage best way canbut must kind them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk way want go Let me see Ill give them new pair boots every Christmas
And went planning herself how would manage
They must go by carrier thought how funny itll seem sending presents ones own feet And how odd directions will look Alices Right Foot Esq
Hearthrug near Fender Alices love
Oh dear what nonsense Im talking Just then head struck against roof hall fact now more than nine feet high once took up little golden key hurried off garden door
Poor Alice much could do lying down one side look through into garden one eye but get through more hopeless than ever sat down began cry again
You ought ashamed yourself said Alice great girl like might well say this go crying this way Stop this moment tell But went all same shedding gallons tears until there large pool all round about four inches deep reaching half down hall
After time heard little pattering feet distance hastily dried eyes see what coming
White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed pair white kid gloves one hand large fan other came trotting along great hurry muttering himself came Oh Duchess Duchess Oh wont savage if Ive kept waiting Alice felt desperate that ready ask help any one when Rabbit came near began low timid voice If please sir Rabbit started violently dropped white kid gloves fan skurried away into darkness hard could go
Alice took up fan gloves hall very hot kept fanning herself all time went talking Dear dear How queer everything day And yesterday things went just usual
wonder if Ive been changed night Let me think same when got up this morning almost think can remember feeling little different
But if Im not same next question Who world am Ah thats great puzzle And began thinking over all children knew that were same age herself see if could been changed for any them
Im sure Im not Ada said for hair goes such long ringlets mine doesnt go ringlets all Im sure cant Mabel for know all sorts things oh knows such very little Besides shes Im andoh dear how puzzling all Ill try if know all things used know

How can done that thought
must growing small again
got up went table measure herself by found that nearly could guess now about two feet high going shrinking rapidly soon found out that cause this fan holding dropped hastily just time avoid shrinking away altogether
That narrow escape said Alice good deal frightened sudden change but very glad find herself still existence now for garden ran all speed back little door but alas little door shut again little golden key lying glass table before things are worse than ever thought poor child for never small this before never And declare its too bad that As said these words foot slipped another moment splash up chin salt water
first idea that somehow fallen into sea that case can go back by railway said herself
Alice been seaside once life come general conclusion that wherever go English coast find number bathing machines sea some children digging sand wooden spades then row lodging houses behind them railway station
However soon made out that pool tears which wept when nine feet high
wish hadnt cried much said Alice swam about trying find way out
shall punished for now suppose by being drowned my own tears That will queer thing sure However everything queer day
Just then heard something splashing about pool little way off swam nearer make out what first thought must walrus or hippopotamus but then remembered how small now soon made out that only mouse that slipped like herself
Would any use now thought Alice speak this mouse Everything out way down here that should think very likely can talk any rate theres no harm trying
So began O Mouse do know way out this pool am very tired swimming about here O Mouse Alice thought this must right way speaking mouse never done such thing before but remembered having seen brothers Latin Grammar A mouseof mouseto mousea mouseO mouse Mouse looked rather inquisitively seemed wink one its little eyes but said nothing
Perhaps doesnt understand English thought Alice daresay its French mouse come over William Conqueror
For all knowledge history Alice no very clear notion how long ago anything happened
So began again OÃ¹ est ma chatte which first sentence French lesson book
Mouse gave sudden leap out water seemed quiver all over fright
Oh beg your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that hurt poor animals feelings
quite forgot didnt like cats
Not like cats cried Mouse shrill passionate voice
Would like cats if were me Well perhaps not said Alice soothing tone dont angry about
And yet wish could show our cat Dinah think youd take fancy cats if could only see
such dear quiet thing Alice went half herself swam lazily about pool sits purring nicely by fire licking paws washing faceand such nice soft thing nurseand shes such capital one for catching miceoh beg your pardon cried Alice again for this time Mouse bristling all over felt certain must really offended
We wont talk about any more if youd rather not
We indeed cried Mouse who trembling down end tail
As if would talk such subject Our family always hated cats nasty low vulgar things Dont let me hear name again wont indeed said Alice great hurry change subject conversation

So called softly after Mouse dear Do come back again we wont talk about cats or dogs either if dont like them When Mouse heard this turned round swam slowly back its face quite pale passion Alice thought said low trembling voice Let us get shore then Ill tell my history youll understand why hate cats dogs
high time go for pool getting quite crowded birds animals that fallen into there were Duck Dodo Lory an Eaglet several other curious creatures
Alice led way whole party swam shore
CHAPTER III
A Caucus Race Long Tale They were indeed queer looking party that assembled bankthe birds draggled feathers animals their fur clinging close them all dripping wet cross uncomfortable
first question course how get dry again they consultation about this after few minutes seemed quite natural Alice find herself talking familiarly them if known them all life
Indeed quite long argument Lory who last turned sulky would only say am older than must know better this Alice would not allow without knowing how old Lory positively refused tell its age there no more said
At last Mouse who seemed person authority among them called out Sit down all listen me Ill soon make dry enough They all sat down once large ring Mouse middle
Alice kept eyes anxiously fixed for felt sure would catch bad cold if did not get dry very soon
Ahem said Mouse an important air are all ready This driest thing know
Silence all round if please â€˜William Conqueror whose cause favoured by pope soon submitted by English who wanted leaders been late much accustomed usurpation conquest
Edwin Morcar earls Mercia Northumbria Ugh said Lory shiver

thought did said Mouse
proceed
â€˜Edwin Morcar earls Mercia Northumbria declared for him even Stigand patriotic archbishop Canterbury found advisable Found what said Duck
Found Mouse replied rather crossly course know what â€˜it means
know what â€˜it means well enough when find thing said Duck its generally frog or worm
question what did archbishop find Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went â€˜found advisable go Edgar Atheling meet William offer him crown
Williams conduct first moderate
But insolence Normans How are getting now my dear continued turning Alice spoke
As wet ever said Alice melancholy tone doesnt seem dry me all
In that case said Dodo solemnly rising its feet move that meeting adjourn for immediate adoption more energetic remedies Speak English said Eaglet
dont know meaning half those long words whats more dont believe do either And Eaglet bent down its head hide smile some other birds tittered audibly
What going say said Dodo an offended tone that best thing get us dry would Caucus race
What Caucus race said Alice not that wanted much know but Dodo paused if thought that somebody ought speak no one else seemed inclined say anything
Why said Dodo best way explain do
And might like try thing yourself some winter day will tell how Dodo managed
First marked out race course sort circle exact shape doesnt matter said then all party were placed along course here there
There no One two three away but they began running when they liked left off when they liked that not easy know when race over
However when they been running half an hour or were quite dry again Dodo suddenly called out race over they all crowded round panting asking But who has won This question Dodo could not answer without great deal thought sat for long time one finger pressed upon its forehead position which usually see Shakespeare pictures him while rest waited silence
At last Dodo said Everybody has won all must prizes
But who give prizes quite chorus voices asked
Why course said Dodo pointing Alice one finger whole party once crowded round calling out confused way Prizes Prizes Alice no idea what do despair put hand pocket pulled out box comfits luckily salt water not got into handed them round prizes
There exactly one piece all round
But must prize herself know said Mouse
Of course Dodo replied very gravely
What else got your pocket went turning Alice
Only thimble said Alice sadly
Hand over here said Dodo
Then they all crowded round once more while Dodo solemnly presented thimble saying We beg your acceptance this elegant thimble when finished this short speech they all cheered
Alice thought whole thing very absurd but they all looked grave that did not dare laugh could not think anything say simply bowed took thimble looking solemn could
next thing eat comfits this caused some noise confusion large birds complained that they could not taste theirs small ones choked patted back
However over last they sat down again ring begged Mouse tell them something more
You promised tell me your history know said Alice why hateC D added whisper half afraid that would offended again
Mine long sad tale said Mouse turning Alice sighing
long tail certainly said Alice looking down wonder Mouses tail but why do call sad And kept puzzling about while Mouse speaking that idea tale something like this Fury said mouse That met house â€˜Let us both go law will prosecute
Come Ill take no denial We must trial For really this morning Ive nothing do
Said mouse cur â€˜Such trial dear sir With no jury or judge would wasting our breath
â€˜Ill judge Ill jury Said cunning old Fury â€˜Ill try whole cause condemn death
You are not attending said Mouse Alice severely
What are thinking beg your pardon said Alice very humbly got fifth bend think not cried Mouse sharply very angrily
A knot said Alice always ready make herself useful looking anxiously about
Oh do let me help undo shall do nothing sort said Mouse getting up walking away
You insult me by talking such nonsense didnt mean pleaded poor Alice
But youre easily offended know Mouse only growled reply
Please come back finish your story Alice called after others all joined chorus Yes please do but Mouse only shook its head impatiently walked little quicker
What pity wouldnt stay sighed Lory soon quite out sight an old Crab took opportunity saying daughter Ah my dear Let this lesson never lose your temper Hold your tongue Ma said young Crab little snappishly
Youre enough try patience an oyster wish our Dinah here know do said Alice aloud addressing nobody particular
Shed soon fetch back And who Dinah if might venture ask question said Lory
Alice replied eagerly for always ready talk about pet Dinahs our cat
And shes such capital one for catching mice cant think And oh wish could see after birds Why shell eat little bird soon look This speech caused remarkable sensation among party
Some birds hurried off once one old Magpie began wrapping itself up very carefully remarking really must getting home night air doesnt suit my throat Canary called out trembling voice its children Come away my dears Its high time were all bed On various pretexts they all moved off Alice soon left alone
wish hadnt mentioned Dinah said herself melancholy tone
Nobody seems like down here Im sure shes best cat world Oh my dear Dinah wonder if shall ever see any more And here poor Alice began cry again for felt very lonely low spirited
In little while however again heard little pattering footsteps distance looked up eagerly half hoping that Mouse changed mind coming back finish story
CHAPTER IV
Rabbit Sends Little Bill White Rabbit trotting slowly back again looking anxiously about went if lost something heard muttering itself Duchess Duchess Oh my dear paws Oh my fur whiskers Shell get me executed sure ferrets are ferrets Where can dropped them wonder Alice guessed moment that looking for fan pair white kid gloves very good naturedly began hunting about for them but they were nowhere seeneverything seemed changed since swim pool great hall glass table little door vanished completely
Very soon Rabbit noticed Alice went hunting about called out an angry tone Why Mary Ann what are doing out here Run home this moment fetch me pair gloves fan Quick now And Alice much frightened that ran off once direction pointed without trying explain mistake made
took me for housemaid said herself ran
How surprised hell when finds out who am But Id better take him fan glovesthat if can find them
As said this came upon neat little house door which bright brass plate name W
RABBIT engraved upon
went without knocking hurried upstairs great fear lest should meet real Mary Ann turned out house before found fan gloves
How queer seems Alice said herself going messages for rabbit suppose Dinahll sending me messages next And began fancying sort thing that would happen â€˜Miss Alice Come here directly get ready for your walk â€˜Coming minute nurse But Ive got see that mouse doesnt get out
Only dont think Alice went that theyd let Dinah stop house if began ordering people about like that By this time found way into tidy little room table window hoped fan two or three pairs tiny white kid gloves took up fan pair gloves just going leave room when eye fell upon little bottle that stood near looking glass
There no label this time words DRINK ME but nevertheless uncorked put lips
know something interesting sure happen said herself whenever eat or drink anything Ill just see what this bottle does
do hope itll make me grow large again for really Im quite tired being such tiny little thing did indeed much sooner than expected before drunk half bottle found head pressing against ceiling stoop save neck from being broken
hastily put down bottle saying herself Thats quite enoughI hope shant grow any moreAs cant get out doorI do wish hadnt drunk quite much Alas too late wish that went growing growing very soon kneel down floor another minute there not even room for this tried effect lying down one elbow against door other arm curled round head
Still went growing last resource put one arm out window one foot up chimney said herself Now can do no more whatever happens
What will become me Luckily for Alice little magic bottle now its full effect grew no larger still very uncomfortable there seemed no sort chance ever getting out room again no wonder felt unhappy
much pleasanter home thought poor Alice when one wasnt always growing larger smaller being ordered about by mice rabbits
almost wish hadnt gone down that rabbit holeand yetand yetits rather curious know this sort life do wonder what can happened me When used read fairy tales fancied that kind thing never happened now here am middle one There ought book written about me that there ought And when grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now added sorrowful tone least theres no room grow up any more here
But then thought Alice shall never get any older than am now Thatll comfort one waynever an old womanbut thenalways lessons learn Oh shouldnt like that Oh foolish Alice answered herself
How can learn lessons here Why theres hardly room for no room all for any lesson books And went taking first one side then other making quite conversation altogether but after few minutes heard voice outside stopped listen
Mary Ann Mary Ann said voice
Fetch me my gloves this moment Then came little pattering feet stairs
Alice knew Rabbit coming look for trembled till shook house quite forgetting that now about thousand times large Rabbit no reason afraid
Presently Rabbit came up door tried open but door opened inwards Alices elbow pressed hard against that attempt proved failure
Alice heard say itself Then Ill go round get window
That wont thought Alice after waiting till fancied heard Rabbit just under window suddenly spread out hand made snatch air
did not get hold anything but heard little shriek fall crash broken glass from which concluded that just possible fallen into cucumber frame or something sort
Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat Where are And then voice never heard before Sure then Im here Digging for apples yer honour Digging for apples indeed said Rabbit angrily
Here Come help me out this Sounds more broken glass
Now tell me Pat whats that window Sure its an arm yer honour pronounced arrum
An arm goose Who ever saw one that size Why fills whole window Sure does yer honour but its an arm for all that
Well its got no business there any rate go take away There long silence after this Alice could only hear whispers now then such Sure dont like yer honour all all Do tell coward last spread out hand again made another snatch air
This time there were two little shrieks more sounds broken glass
What number cucumber frames there must thought Alice
wonder what theyll do next As for pulling me out window only wish they could Im sure dont want stay here any longer waited for some time without hearing anything more last came rumbling little cartwheels sound good many voices all talking together made out words Wheres other ladderWhy hadnt bring but one Bills got otherBill fetch here ladHere put em up this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont particularHere Bill catch hold this ropeWill roof bearMind that loose slateOh its coming down Heads below loud crashNow who did thatIt Bill fancyWhos go down chimneyNay shant You do itThat wont thenBills go downHere Bill master says youre go down chimney Oh So Bills got come down chimney has said Alice herself
Shy they seem put everything upon Bill wouldnt Bills place for good deal this fireplace narrow sure but think can kick little drew foot far down chimney could waited till heard little animal couldnt guess what sort scratching scrambling about chimney close above then saying herself This Bill gave one sharp kick waited see what would happen next
first thing heard general chorus There goes Bill then Rabbits voice alongCatch him by hedge then silence then another confusion voicesHold up headBrandy nowDont choke himHow old fellow What happened Tell us all about Last came little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill thought Alice Well hardly knowNo more thank ye Im better nowbut Im deal too flustered tell youall know something comes me like Jack box up goes like sky rocket So did old fellow said others
We must burn house down said Rabbits voice Alice called out loud could If do Ill set Dinah There dead silence instantly Alice thought herself wonder what they will do next If they any sense theyd take roof off
After minute or two they began moving about again Alice heard Rabbit say A barrowful will do begin
A barrowful what thought Alice but not long doubt for next moment shower little pebbles came rattling window some them hit face
Ill put stop this said herself shouted out Youd better not do that again which produced another dead silence
Alice noticed some surprise that pebbles were all turning into little cakes they lay floor bright idea came into head
If eat one these cakes thought its sure make some change my size cant possibly make me larger must make me smaller suppose
So swallowed one cakes delighted find that began shrinking directly
As soon small enough get through door ran out house found quite crowd little animals birds waiting outside
poor little Lizard Bill middle being held up by two guinea pigs who were giving something out bottle
They all made rush Alice moment appeared but ran off hard could soon found herself safe thick wood
first thing Ive got do said Alice herself wandered about wood grow my right size again second thing find my way into that lovely garden
think that will best plan
sounded an excellent plan no doubt very neatly simply arranged only difficulty that not smallest idea how set about while peering about anxiously among trees little sharp bark just over head made look up great hurry
An enormous puppy looking down large round eyes feebly stretching out one paw trying touch
Poor little thing said Alice coaxing tone tried hard whistle but terribly frightened all time thought that might hungry which case would very likely eat up spite all coaxing
Hardly knowing what did picked up little bit stick held out puppy whereupon puppy jumped into air off all its feet once yelp delight rushed stick made believe worry then Alice dodged behind great thistle keep herself from being run over moment appeared other side puppy made another rush stick tumbled head over heels its hurry get hold then Alice thinking very like having game play cart horse expecting every moment trampled under its feet ran round thistle again then puppy began series short charges stick running very little way forwards each time long way back barking hoarsely all while till last sat down good way off panting its tongue hanging out its mouth its great eyes half shut
This seemed Alice good opportunity for making escape set off once ran till quite tired out breath till puppys bark sounded quite faint distance
And yet what dear little puppy said Alice leant against buttercup rest herself fanned herself one leaves should liked teaching tricks very much ifif Id only been right size do Oh dear Id nearly forgotten that Ive got grow up again Let me seehow managed suppose ought eat or drink something or other but great question what great question certainly what Alice looked all round flowers blades grass but did not see anything that looked like right thing eat or drink under circumstances
There large mushroom growing near about same height herself when looked under both sides behind occurred that might well look see what top
stretched herself up tiptoe peeped over edge mushroom eyes immediately met those large blue caterpillar that sitting top its arms folded quietly smoking long hookah taking not smallest notice or anything else
CHAPTER V
Advice from Caterpillar Caterpillar Alice looked each other for some time silence last Caterpillar took hookah out its mouth addressed languid sleepy voice
Who are said Caterpillar
This not an encouraging opening for conversation
Alice replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just presentat least know who when got up this morning but think must been changed several times since then
What do mean by that said Caterpillar sternly
Explain yourself cant explain myself Im afraid sir said Alice because Im not myself see
dont see said Caterpillar
Im afraid cant put more clearly Alice replied very politely for cant understand myself begin being many different sizes day very confusing

Well perhaps havent found yet said Alice but when turn into chrysalisyou will some day knowand then after that into butterfly should think youll feel little queer wont Not bit said Caterpillar
Well perhaps your feelings may different said Alice all know would feel very queer me
You said Caterpillar contemptuously
Who are Which brought them back again beginning conversation
Alice felt little irritated Caterpillars making such very short remarks drew herself up said very gravely think ought tell me who are first
Why said Caterpillar
Here another puzzling question Alice could not think any good reason Caterpillar seemed very unpleasant state mind turned away
Come back Caterpillar called after
Ive something important say This sounded promising certainly Alice turned came back again
Keep your temper said Caterpillar
Is that all said Alice swallowing down anger well could
No said Caterpillar
Alice thought might well wait nothing else do perhaps after all might tell something worth hearing
For some minutes puffed away without speaking but last unfolded its arms took hookah out its mouth again said So think youre changed do Im afraid am sir said Alice cant remember things usedand dont keep same size for ten minutes together Cant remember what things said Caterpillar
Well Ive tried say How doth little busy bee but all came different Alice replied very melancholy voice
Repeat You are old Father William said Caterpillar
Alice folded hands began You are old Father William young man said And your hair has become very white And yet incessantly stand your head Do think your age right In my youth Father William replied son feared might injure brain But now that Im perfectly sure none Why do again again
You are old said youth mentioned before And grown most uncommonly fat Yet turned back somersault door Pray what reason that In my youth said sage shook grey locks kept all my limbs very supple By use this ointmentone shilling box Allow me sell couple You are old said youth your jaws are too weak For anything tougher than suet Yet finished goose bones beak Pray how did manage do In my youth said father took law And argued each case my wife And muscular strength which gave my jaw Has lasted rest my life
You are old said youth one would hardly suppose That your eye steady ever Yet balanced an eel end your nose What made awfully clever answered three questions that enough Said father dont give yourself airs Do think can listen all day such stuff Be off or Ill kick down stairs That not said right said Caterpillar
Not quite right Im afraid said Alice timidly some words got altered
wrong from beginning end said Caterpillar decidedly there silence for some minutes
Caterpillar first speak
What size do want asked
Oh Im not particular size Alice hastily replied only one doesnt like changing often know
dont know said Caterpillar
Alice said nothing never been much contradicted life before felt that losing temper
Are content now said Caterpillar
Well should like little larger sir if wouldnt mind said Alice three inches such wretched height
very good height indeed said Caterpillar angrily rearing itself upright spoke exactly three inches high
But Im not used pleaded poor Alice piteous tone
And thought herself wish creatures wouldnt easily offended Youll get used time said Caterpillar put hookah into its mouth began smoking again
This time Alice waited patiently until chose speak again
In minute or two Caterpillar took hookah out its mouth yawned once or twice shook itself
Then got down off mushroom crawled away grass merely remarking went One side will make grow taller other side will make grow shorter
One side what other side what thought Alice herself
Of mushroom said Caterpillar just if asked aloud another moment out sight
Alice remained looking thoughtfully mushroom for minute trying make out which were two sides perfectly round found this very difficult question
However last stretched arms round far they would go broke off bit edge each hand
And now which which said herself nibbled little right hand bit try effect next moment felt violent blow underneath chin struck foot good deal frightened by this very sudden change but felt that there no time lost shrinking rapidly set work once eat some other bit
chin pressed closely against foot that there hardly room open mouth but did last managed swallow morsel lefthand bit
Come my heads free last said Alice tone delight which changed into alarm another moment when found that shoulders were nowhere found all could see when looked down an immense length neck which seemed rise like stalk out sea green leaves that lay far below
What can all that green stuff said Alice
And where my shoulders got And oh my poor hands how cant see moving them about spoke but no result seemed follow except little shaking among distant green leaves
As there seemed no chance getting hands up head tried get head down them delighted find that neck would bend about easily any direction like serpent
just succeeded curving down into graceful zigzag going dive among leaves which found nothing but tops trees under which been wandering when sharp hiss made draw back hurry large pigeon flown into face beating violently its wings
Serpent screamed Pigeon
Im not serpent said Alice indignantly
Let me alone Serpent say again repeated Pigeon but more subdued tone added kind sob Ive tried every way nothing seems suit them havent least idea what youre talking about said Alice
Ive tried roots trees Ive tried banks Ive tried hedges Pigeon went without attending but those serpents Theres no pleasing them Alice more more puzzled but thought there no use saying anything more till Pigeon finished
As if wasnt trouble enough hatching eggs said Pigeon but must look out for serpents night day Why havent wink sleep these three weeks Im very sorry youve been annoyed said Alice who beginning see its meaning
And just Id taken highest tree wood continued Pigeon raising its voice shriek just thinking should free them last they must needs come wriggling down from sky Ugh Serpent But Im not serpent tell said Alice
Im aIm Well What are said Pigeon
can see youre trying invent something IIm little girl said Alice rather doubtfully remembered number changes gone through that day
A likely story indeed said Pigeon tone deepest contempt
Ive seen good many little girls my time but never one such neck that No no Youre serpent theres no use denying
suppose youll telling me next that never tasted an egg tasted eggs certainly said Alice who very truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite much serpents do know
dont believe said Pigeon but if they do why then theyre kind serpent thats all can say
This such new idea Alice that quite silent for minute or two which gave Pigeon opportunity adding Youre looking for eggs know that well enough what does matter me whether youre little girl or serpent matters good deal me said Alice hastily but Im not looking for eggs happens if shouldnt want yours dont like them raw
Well off then said Pigeon sulky tone settled down again into its nest
Alice crouched down among trees well could for neck kept getting entangled among branches every now then stop untwist
After while remembered that still held pieces mushroom hands set work very carefully nibbling first one then other growing sometimes taller sometimes shorter until succeeded bringing herself down usual height
long since been anything near right size that felt quite strange first but got used few minutes began talking herself usual
Come theres half my plan done now How puzzling all these changes are Im never sure what Im going from one minute another However Ive got back my right size next thing get into that beautiful gardenhow that done wonder As said this came suddenly upon an open place little house about four feet high
Whoever lives there thought Alice itll never do come upon them this size why should frighten them out their wits So began nibbling righthand bit again did not venture go near house till brought herself down nine inches high
CHAPTER VI
Pig Pepper For minute or two stood looking house wondering what do next when suddenly footman livery came running out woodshe considered him footman because livery otherwise judging by face only would called him fishand rapped loudly door knuckles
opened by another footman livery round face large eyes like frog both footmen Alice noticed powdered hair that curled all over their heads
felt very curious know what all about crept little way out wood listen
Fish Footman began by producing from under arm great letter nearly large himself this handed over other saying solemn tone For Duchess
An invitation from Queen play croquet
Frog Footman repeated same solemn tone only changing order words little From Queen
An invitation for Duchess play croquet
Then they both bowed low their curls got entangled together
Alice laughed much this that run back into wood for fear their hearing when next peeped out Fish Footman gone other sitting ground near door staring stupidly up into sky
Alice went timidly up door knocked
Theres no sort use knocking said Footman that for two reasons
First because Im same side door are secondly because theyre making such noise inside no one could possibly hear
And certainly there most extraordinary noise going withina constant howling sneezing every now then great crash if dish or kettle been broken pieces
Please then said Alice how am get There might some sense your knocking Footman went without attending if we door between us
For instance if were inside might knock could let out know
looking up into sky all time speaking this Alice thought decidedly uncivil
But perhaps cant help said herself eyes are very nearly top head
But any rate might answer questions
How am get repeated aloud
shall sit here Footman remarked till tomorrow At this moment door house opened large plate came skimming out straight Footmans head just grazed nose broke pieces against one trees behind him
or next day maybe Footman continued same tone exactly if nothing happened
How am get asked Alice again louder tone
Are get all said Footman
Thats first question know
no doubt only Alice did not like told
Its really dreadful muttered herself way all creatures argue
Its enough drive one crazy Footman seemed think this good opportunity for repeating remark variations
shall sit here said off for days days
But what am do said Alice
Anything like said Footman began whistling
Oh theres no use talking him said Alice desperately hes perfectly idiotic And opened door went
door led right into large kitchen which full smoke from one end other Duchess sitting three legged stool middle nursing baby cook leaning over fire stirring large cauldron which seemed full soup
Theres certainly too much pepper that soup Alice said herself well could for sneezing
There certainly too much air
Even Duchess sneezed occasionally for baby sneezing howling alternately without moments pause
only things kitchen that did not sneeze were cook large cat which sitting hearth grinning from ear ear
Please would tell me said Alice little timidly for not quite sure whether good manners for speak first why your cat grins like that Its Cheshire cat said Duchess thats why
Pig said last word such sudden violence that Alice quite jumped but saw another moment that addressed baby not took courage went again didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned fact didnt know that cats could grin
They all can said Duchess most em do
dont know any that do Alice said very politely feeling quite pleased got into conversation
You dont know much said Duchess thats fact
Alice did not all like tone this remark thought would well introduce some other subject conversation
While trying fix one cook took cauldron soup off fire once set work throwing everything within reach Duchess babythe fire irons came first then followed shower saucepans plates dishes
Duchess took no notice them even when they hit baby howling much already that quite impossible say whether blows hurt or not
Oh please mind what youre doing cried Alice jumping up down an agony terror
Oh there goes precious nose an unusually large saucepan flew close by very nearly carried off
If everybody minded their own business Duchess said hoarse growl world would go round deal faster than does
Which would not an advantage said Alice who felt very glad get an opportunity showing off little knowledge
Just think what work would make day night You see earth takes twenty four hours turn round its axis Talking axes said Duchess chop off head Alice glanced rather anxiously cook see if meant take hint but cook busily stirring soup seemed not listening went again Twenty four hours think or twelve Oh dont bother me said Duchess never could abide figures And that began nursing child again singing sort lullaby did giving violent shake end every line Speak roughly your little boy And beat him when sneezes only does annoy Because knows teases
CHORUS
In which cook baby joined Wow wow wow While Duchess sang second verse song kept tossing baby violently up down poor little thing howled that Alice could hardly hear words speak severely my boy beat him when sneezes For can thoroughly enjoy pepper when pleases CHORUS
Wow wow wow Here may nurse bit if like Duchess said Alice flinging baby spoke
must go get ready play croquet Queen hurried out room
cook threw frying pan after went out but just missed
Alice caught baby some difficulty queer shaped little creature held out its arms legs all directions just like star fish thought Alice
poor little thing snorting like steam engine when caught kept doubling itself up straightening itself out again that altogether for first minute or two much could do hold
As soon made out proper way nursing which twist up into sort knot then keep tight hold its right ear left foot prevent its undoing itself carried out into open air
If dont take this child away me thought Alice theyre sure kill day or two wouldnt murder leave behind said last words out loud little thing grunted reply left off sneezing by this time
Dont grunt said Alice thats not all proper way expressing yourself
baby grunted again Alice looked very anxiously into its face see what matter
There could no doubt that very turn up nose much more like snout than real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for baby altogether Alice did not like look thing all
But perhaps only sobbing thought looked into its eyes again see if there were any tears
No there were no tears
If youre going turn into pig my dear said Alice seriously Ill nothing more do
Mind now poor little thing sobbed again or grunted impossible say which they went for some while silence
Alice just beginning think herself Now what am do this creature when get home when grunted again violently that looked down into its face some alarm
This time there could no mistake about neither more nor less than pig felt that would quite absurd for carry further
So set little creature down felt quite relieved see trot away quietly into wood
If grown up said herself would made dreadfully ugly child but makes rather handsome pig think
And began thinking over other children knew who might do very well pigs just saying herself if one only knew right way change them when little startled by seeing Cheshire Cat sitting bough tree few yards off
Cat only grinned when saw Alice
looked good natured thought still very long claws great many teeth felt that ought treated respect
Cheshire Puss began rather timidly did not all know whether would like name however only grinned little wider
Come its pleased far thought Alice went
Would tell me please which way ought go from here That depends good deal where want get said Cat
dont much care where said Alice
Then doesnt matter which way go said Cat

Oh youre sure do that said Cat if only walk long enough
Alice felt that this could not denied tried another question

But dont want go among mad people Alice remarked
Oh cant help that said Cat were all mad here

Alice not much surprised this getting used queer things happening
While looking place where been suddenly appeared again

As said this looked up there Cat again sitting branch tree
Did say pig or fig said Cat

All right said Cat this time vanished quite slowly beginning end tail ending grin which remained some time after rest gone
Well Ive often seen cat without grin thought Alice but grin without cat Its most curious thing ever saw my life not gone much farther before came sight house March Hare thought must right house because chimneys were shaped like ears roof thatched fur
large house that did not like go nearer till nibbled some more lefthand bit mushroom raised herself about two feet high even then walked up towards rather timidly saying herself Suppose should raving mad after all almost wish Id gone see Hatter instead CHAPTER VII
A Mad Tea Party There table set out under tree front house March Hare Hatter were having tea Dormouse sitting between them fast asleep other two were using cushion resting their elbows talking over its head
Very uncomfortable for Dormouse thought Alice only its asleep suppose doesnt mind
table large one but three were all crowded together one corner No room No room they cried out when they saw Alice coming
Theres plenty room said Alice indignantly sat down large arm chair one end table

Hatter first break silence

Alice considered little then said fourth
Two days wrong sighed Hatter
told butter wouldnt suit works added looking angrily March Hare

Yes but some crumbs must got well Hatter grumbled shouldnt put bread knife
March Hare took watch looked gloomily then dipped into cup tea looked again but could think nothing better say than first remark best butter know
Alice been looking over shoulder some curiosity
What funny watch remarked

Does your watch tell what year Of course not Alice replied very readily but thats because stays same year for such long time together
Which just case mine said Hatter
Alice felt dreadfully puzzled
Hatters remark seemed no sort meaning yet certainly English
dont quite understand said politely could
Dormouse asleep again said Hatter poured little hot tea upon its nose
Dormouse shook its head impatiently said without opening its eyes Of course course just what going remark myself
Have guessed riddle yet Hatter said turning Alice again
No give up Alice replied whats answer havent slightest idea said Hatter

Alice sighed wearily
think might do something better time said than waste asking riddles that no answers
If knew Time well do said Hatter wouldnt talk about wasting
Its him

Of course dont Hatter said tossing head contemptuously

Ah that accounts for said Hatter

Now if only kept good terms him hed do almost anything liked clock
For instance suppose were nine oclock morning just time begin lessons youd only whisper hint Time round goes clock twinkling Half past one time for dinner only wish March Hare said itself whisper
That would grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully but thenI shouldnt hungry for know
Not first perhaps said Hatter but could keep half past one long liked

Hatter shook head mournfully
Not replied
We quarrelled last Marchjust before went mad know pointing tea spoon March Hare great concert given by Queen Hearts sing â€˜Twinkle twinkle little bat How wonder what youre You know song perhaps Ive heard something like said Alice

Twinkle twinkle Here Dormouse shook itself began singing its sleep Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle went long that they pinch make stop
Well Id hardly finished first verse said Hatter when Queen jumped up bawled out â€˜Hes murdering time Off head How dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice
And ever since that Hatter went mournful tone wont do thing ask Its always six oclock now
A bright idea came into Alices head
Is that reason many tea things are put out here asked
Yes thats said Hatter sigh its always tea time weve no time wash things between whiles
Then keep moving round suppose said Alice
Exactly said Hatter things get used up
But what happens when come beginning again Alice ventured ask
Suppose we change subject March Hare interrupted yawning
Im getting tired this

Im afraid dont know one said Alice rather alarmed proposal
Then Dormouse shall they both cried
Wake up Dormouse And they pinched both sides once
Dormouse slowly opened eyes
wasnt asleep said hoarse feeble voice heard every word fellows were saying
Tell us story said March Hare
Yes please do pleaded Alice
And quick about added Hatter or youll asleep again before its done
Once upon time there were three little sisters Dormouse began great hurry their names were Elsie Lacie Tillie they lived bottom well What did they live said Alice who always took great interest questions eating drinking
They lived treacle said Dormouse after thinking minute or two
They couldnt done that know Alice gently remarked theyd been ill
So they were said Dormouse very ill
Alice tried fancy herself what such an extraordinary ways living would like but puzzled too much went But why did they live bottom well Take some more tea March Hare said Alice very earnestly
Ive nothing yet Alice replied an offended tone cant take more
You mean cant take less said Hatter its very easy take more than nothing
Nobody asked your opinion said Alice
Whos making personal remarks now Hatter asked triumphantly
Alice did not quite know what say this helped herself some tea bread butter then turned Dormouse repeated question
Why did they live bottom well Dormouse again took minute or two think about then said treacle well
Theres no such thing Alice beginning very angrily but Hatter March Hare went Sh sh Dormouse sulkily remarked If cant civil youd better finish story for yourself
No please go Alice said very humbly wont interrupt again

One indeed said Dormouse indignantly
However consented go
And these three little sistersthey were learning draw know What did they draw said Alice quite forgetting promise
Treacle said Dormouse without considering all this time
want clean cup interrupted Hatter lets all move one place
moved spoke Dormouse followed him March Hare moved into Dormouses place Alice rather unwillingly took place March Hare
Hatter only one who got any advantage from change Alice good deal worse off than before March Hare just upset milk jug into plate
Alice did not wish offend Dormouse again began very cautiously But dont understand
Where did they draw treacle from You can draw water out water well said Hatter should think could draw treacle out treacle welleh stupid But they were well Alice said Dormouse not choosing notice this last remark
Of course they were said Dormouse well
This answer confused poor Alice that let Dormouse go for some time without interrupting
They were learning draw Dormouse went yawning rubbing its eyes for getting very sleepy they drew all manner thingseverything that begins an M Why an M said Alice
Why not said March Hare
Alice silent
Dormouse closed its eyes by this time going off into doze but being pinched by Hatter woke up again little shriek went that begins an M such mouse traps moon memory muchnessyou know say things are much muchnessdid ever see such thing drawing muchness Really now ask me said Alice very much confused dont think Then shouldnt talk said Hatter
This piece rudeness more than Alice could bear got up great disgust walked off Dormouse fell asleep instantly neither others took least notice going though looked back once or twice half hoping that they would call after last time saw them they were trying put Dormouse into teapot
At any rate Ill never go there again said Alice picked way through wood
Its stupidest tea party ever all my life Just said this noticed that one trees door leading right into
Thats very curious thought
But everythings curious today
think may well go once
And went
Once more found herself long hall close little glass table
Now Ill manage better this time said herself began by taking little golden key unlocking door that led into garden
Then went work nibbling mushroom kept piece pocket till about foot high then walked down little passage thenshe found herself last beautiful garden among bright flower beds cool fountains
CHAPTER VIII
Queens Croquet Ground A large rose tree stood near entrance garden roses growing were white but there were three gardeners busily painting them red
Alice thought this very curious thing went nearer watch them just came up them heard one them say Look out now Five Dont go splashing paint over me like that couldnt help said Five sulky tone Seven jogged my elbow
On which Seven looked up said Thats right Five Always lay blame others Youd better not talk said Five
heard Queen say only yesterday deserved beheaded What for said one who spoken first
Thats none your business Two said Seven
Yes business said Five Ill tell himit for bringing cook tulip roots instead onions
Seven flung down brush just begun Well all unjust things when eye chanced fall upon Alice stood watching them checked himself suddenly others looked round also all them bowed low
Would tell me said Alice little timidly why are painting those roses Five Seven said nothing but looked Two
Two began low voice Why fact see Miss this here ought been red rose tree we put white one by mistake if Queen find out we should all our heads cut off know
So see Miss were doing our best afore comes At this moment Five who been anxiously looking across garden called out Queen Queen three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon their faces
There sound many footsteps Alice looked round eager see Queen
First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped like three gardeners oblong flat their hands feet corners next ten courtiers these were ornamented all over diamonds walked two two soldiers did
After these came royal children there were ten them little dears came jumping merrily along hand hand couples they were all ornamented hearts
Next came guests mostly Kings Queens among them Alice recognised White Rabbit talking hurried nervous manner smiling everything that said went by without noticing
Then followed Knave Hearts carrying Kings crown crimson velvet cushion last all this grand procession came KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS
Alice rather doubtful whether ought not lie down face like three gardeners but could not remember ever having heard such rule processions besides what would use procession thought if people all lie down upon their faces that they couldnt see So stood still where waited
When procession came opposite Alice they all stopped looked Queen said severely Who this said Knave Hearts who only bowed smiled reply
Idiot said Queen tossing head impatiently turning Alice went Whats your name child My name Alice please your Majesty said Alice very politely but added herself Why theyre only pack cards after all
neednt afraid them And who are these said Queen pointing three gardeners who were lying round rose tree for see they were lying their faces pattern their backs same rest pack could not tell whether they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three own children
How should know said Alice surprised own courage
Its no business mine
Queen turned crimson fury after glaring for moment like wild beast screamed Off head Off Nonsense said Alice very loudly decidedly Queen silent
King laid hand upon arm timidly said Consider my dear only child Queen turned angrily away from him said Knave Turn them over Knave did very carefully one foot
Get up said Queen shrill loud voice three gardeners instantly jumped up began bowing King Queen royal children everybody else
Leave off that screamed Queen
You make me giddy
And then turning rose tree went What been doing here May please your Majesty said Two very humble tone going down one knee spoke we were trying see said Queen who meanwhile been examining roses
Off their heads procession moved three soldiers remaining behind execute unfortunate gardeners who ran Alice for protection
You shant beheaded said Alice put them into large flower pot that stood near
three soldiers wandered about for minute or two looking for them then quietly marched off after others
Are their heads off shouted Queen
Their heads are gone if please your Majesty soldiers shouted reply
Thats right shouted Queen
Can play croquet soldiers were silent looked Alice question evidently meant for
Yes shouted Alice
Come then roared Queen Alice joined procession wondering very much what would happen next
Itsits very fine day said timid voice side
walking by White Rabbit who peeping anxiously into face
Very said Alice wheres Duchess Hush Hush said Rabbit low hurried tone
looked anxiously over shoulder spoke then raised himself upon tiptoe put mouth close ear whispered Shes under sentence execution
What for said Alice
Did say â€˜What pity Rabbit asked
No didnt said Alice dont think its all pity
said â€˜What for boxed Queens ears Rabbit began
Alice gave little scream laughter
Oh hush Rabbit whispered frightened tone
Queen will hear You see came rather late Queen said Get your places shouted Queen voice thunder people began running about all directions tumbling up against each other however they got settled down minute or two game began
Alice thought never seen such curious croquet ground life all ridges furrows balls were live hedgehogs mallets live flamingoes soldiers double themselves up stand their hands feet make arches
chief difficulty Alice found first managing flamingo succeeded getting its body tucked away comfortably enough under arm its legs hanging down but generally just got its neck nicely straightened out going give hedgehog blow its head would twist itself round look up face such puzzled expression that could not help bursting out laughing when got its head down going begin again very provoking find that hedgehog unrolled itself act crawling away besides all this there generally ridge or furrow way wherever wanted send hedgehog doubled up soldiers were always getting up walking off other parts ground Alice soon came conclusion that very difficult game indeed
players all played once without waiting for turns quarrelling all while fighting for hedgehogs very short time Queen furious passion went stamping about shouting Off head or Off head about once minute
Alice began feel very uneasy sure not yet any dispute Queen but knew that might happen any minute then thought what would become me Theyre dreadfully fond beheading people here great wonder that theres any one left alive looking about for some way escape wondering whether could get away without being seen when noticed curious appearance air puzzled very much first but after watching minute or two made out grin said herself Its Cheshire Cat now shall somebody talk
How are getting said Cat soon there mouth enough for speak
Alice waited till eyes appeared then nodded
Its no use speaking thought till its ears come or least one them
In another minute whole head appeared then Alice put down flamingo began an account game feeling very glad someone listen
Cat seemed think that there enough now sight no more appeared
dont think they play all fairly Alice began rather complaining tone they all quarrel dreadfully one cant hear oneself speakand they dont seem any rules particular least if there are nobody attends themand youve no idea how confusing all things being alive for instance theres arch Ive got go through next walking about other end groundand should croqueted Queens hedgehog just now only ran away when saw mine coming How do like Queen said Cat low voice
Not all said Alice shes extremely Just then noticed that Queen close behind listening went likely win that its hardly worth while finishing game
Queen smiled passed
Who are talking said King going up Alice looking Cats head great curiosity
Its friend minea Cheshire Cat said Alice allow me introduce
dont like look all said King however may kiss my hand if likes
Id rather not Cat remarked
Dont impertinent said King dont look me like that got behind Alice spoke
A cat may look king said Alice
Ive read that some book but dont remember where
Well must removed said King very decidedly called Queen who passing moment My dear wish would this cat removed Queen only one way settling all difficulties great or small
Off head said without even looking round
Ill fetch executioner myself said King eagerly hurried off
Alice thought might well go back see how game going heard Queens voice distance screaming passion
already heard sentence three players executed for having missed their turns did not like look things all game such confusion that never knew whether turn or not
So went search hedgehog
hedgehog engaged fight another hedgehog which seemed Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one them other only difficulty that flamingo gone across other side garden where Alice could see trying helpless sort way fly up into tree
By time caught flamingo brought back fight over both hedgehogs were out sight but doesnt matter much thought Alice all arches are gone from this side ground
So tucked away under arm that might not escape again went back for little more conversation friend
When got back Cheshire Cat surprised find quite large crowd collected round there dispute going between executioner King Queen who were all talking once while all rest were quite silent looked very uncomfortable
moment Alice appeared appealed by all three settle question they repeated their arguments though they all spoke once found very hard indeed make out exactly what they said
executioners argument that couldnt cut off head unless there body cut off from that never do such thing before wasnt going begin time life
Kings argument that anything that head could beheaded that werent talk nonsense
Queens argument that if something wasnt done about less than no time shed everybody executed all round
this last remark that made whole party look grave anxious
Alice could think nothing else say but belongs Duchess youd better ask about
Shes prison Queen said executioner fetch here
And executioner went off like an arrow
Cats head began fading away moment gone by time come back Duchess entirely disappeared King executioner ran wildly up down looking for while rest party went back game
CHAPTER IX
Mock Turtles Story You cant think how glad am see again dear old thing said Duchess tucked arm affectionately into Alices they walked off together
Alice very glad find such pleasant temper thought herself that perhaps only pepper that made savage when they met kitchen
When Im Duchess said herself not very hopeful tone though wont any pepper my kitchen all
Soup does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that makes people hot tempered went very much pleased having found out new kind rule vinegar that makes them sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barley sugar such things that make children sweet tempered
only wish people knew that then they wouldnt stingy about know quite forgotten Duchess by this time little startled when heard voice close ear
Youre thinking about something my dear that makes forget talk
cant tell just now what moral that but shall remember bit
Perhaps hasnt one Alice ventured remark
Tut tut child said Duchess
Everythings got moral if only can find
And squeezed herself up closer Alices side spoke
Alice did not much like keeping close first because Duchess very ugly secondly because exactly right height rest chin upon Alices shoulder an uncomfortably sharp chin
However did not like rude bore well could
games going rather better now said by way keeping up conversation little
Tis said Duchess moral that isâ€˜Oh tis love tis love that makes world go round Somebody said Alice whispered that its done by everybody minding their own business Ah well means much same thing said Duchess digging sharp little chin into Alices shoulder added moral that isâ€˜Take care sense sounds will take care themselves
How fond finding morals things Alice thought herself
dare say youre wondering why dont put my arm round your waist Duchess said after pause reason that Im doubtful about temper your flamingo
Shall try experiment might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling all anxious experiment tried
Very true said Duchess flamingoes mustard both bite
And moral that isâ€˜Birds feather flock together
Only mustard isnt bird Alice remarked
Right usual said Duchess what clear way putting things Its mineral think said Alice
Of course said Duchess who seemed ready agree everything that Alice said theres large mustard mine near here
And moral that isâ€˜The more there mine less there yours
Oh know exclaimed Alice who not attended this last remark its vegetable
doesnt look like one but
quite agree said Duchess moral that isâ€˜Be what would seem beor if youd like put more simplyâ€˜Never imagine yourself not otherwise than what might appear others that what were or might been not otherwise than what been would appeared them otherwise

Thats nothing what could say if chose Duchess replied pleased tone
Pray dont trouble yourself say any longer than that said Alice
Oh dont talk about trouble said Duchess

A cheap sort present thought Alice
Im glad they dont give birthday presents like that But did not venture say out loud
Thinking again Duchess asked another dig sharp little chin
Ive right think said Alice sharply for beginning feel little worried
Just about much right said Duchess pigs fly m But here Alices great surprise Duchesss voice died away even middle favourite word â€˜moral arm that linked into hers began tremble
Alice looked up there stood Queen front them arms folded frowning like thunderstorm
A fine day your Majesty Duchess began low weak voice
Now give fair warning shouted Queen stamping ground spoke either or your head must off that about half no time Take your choice Duchess took choice gone moment
Lets go game Queen said Alice Alice too much frightened say word but slowly followed back croquet ground
other guests taken advantage Queens absence were resting shade however moment they saw they hurried back game Queen merely remarking that moments delay would cost them their lives
All time they were playing Queen never left off quarrelling other players shouting Off head or Off head Those whom sentenced were taken into custody by soldiers who course leave off being arches do this that by end half an hour or there were no arches left all players except King Queen Alice were custody under sentence execution
Then Queen left off quite out breath said Alice Have seen Mock Turtle yet No said Alice

Its thing Mock Turtle Soup made from said Queen

Come then said Queen shall tell history As they walked off together Alice heard King say low voice company generally You are all pardoned

They very soon came upon Gryphon lying fast asleep sun
If dont know what Gryphon look picture
Up lazy thing said Queen take this young lady see Mock Turtle hear history

Alice did not quite like look creature but whole thought would quite safe stay go after that savage Queen waited
Gryphon sat up rubbed its eyes then watched Queen till out sight then chuckled
What fun said Gryphon half itself half Alice
What fun said Alice
Why said Gryphon
Its all fancy that they never executes nobody know
Come Everybody says â€˜come here thought Alice went slowly after never ordered about all my life never They not gone far before they saw Mock Turtle distance sitting sad lonely little ledge rock they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing if heart would break
pitied him deeply
What sorrow asked Gryphon Gryphon answered very nearly same words before Its all fancy that hasnt got no sorrow know
Come So they went up Mock Turtle who looked them large eyes full tears but said nothing
This here young lady said Gryphon wants for know your history do
Ill tell said Mock Turtle deep hollow tone sit down both dont speak word till Ive finished
So they sat down nobody spoke for some minutes
Alice thought herself dont see how can ever finish if doesnt begin
But waited patiently
Once said Mock Turtle last deep sigh real Turtle
These words were followed by very long silence broken only by an occasional exclamation Hjckrrh from Gryphon constant heavy sobbing Mock Turtle
Alice very nearly getting up saying Thank sir for your interesting story but could not help thinking there must more come sat still said nothing
When we were little Mock Turtle went last more calmly though still sobbing little now then we went school sea

We called him Tortoise because taught us said Mock Turtle angrily really are very dull You ought ashamed yourself for asking such simple question added Gryphon then they both sat silent looked poor Alice who felt ready sink into earth
At last Gryphon said Mock Turtle Drive old fellow Dont all day about went these words Yes we went school sea though maynt believe never said didnt interrupted Alice

Who Stole Tarts King Queen Hearts were seated their throne when they arrived great crowd assembled about themall sorts little birds beasts well whole pack cards Knave standing before them chains soldier each side guard him near King White Rabbit trumpet one hand scroll parchment other
In very middle court table large dish tarts upon they looked good that made Alice quite hungry look themI wish theyd get trial done thought hand round refreshments But there seemed no chance this began looking everything about pass away time
Alice never been court justice before but read about them books quite pleased find that knew name nearly everything there
Thats judge said herself because great wig
judge by way King wore crown over wig look frontispiece if want see how did did not look all comfortable certainly not becoming
And thats jury box thought Alice those twelve creatures obliged say creatures see because some them were animals some were birds suppose they are jurors
said this last word two or three times over herself being rather proud for thought rightly too that very few little girls age knew meaning all
However jury men would done just well
twelve jurors were all writing very busily slates
What are they doing Alice whispered Gryphon
They cant anything put down yet before trials begun
Theyre putting down their names Gryphon whispered reply for fear they should forget them before end trial
Stupid things Alice began loud indignant voice but stopped hastily for White Rabbit cried out Silence court King put spectacles looked anxiously round make out who talking
Alice could see well if were looking over their shoulders that all jurors were writing down stupid things their slates could even make out that one them didnt know how spell stupid that ask neighbour tell him
A nice muddle their slatesll before trials over thought Alice
One jurors pencil that squeaked
This course Alice could not stand went round court got behind him very soon found an opportunity taking away
did quickly that poor little juror Bill Lizard could not make out all what become after hunting all about for obliged write one finger for rest day this very little use left no mark slate
Herald read accusation said King
On this White Rabbit blew three blasts trumpet then unrolled parchment scroll read follows Queen Hearts made some tarts All summer day Knave Hearts stole those tarts And took them quite away Consider your verdict King said jury
Not yet not yet Rabbit hastily interrupted
Theres great deal come before that Call first witness said King White Rabbit blew three blasts trumpet called out First witness first witness Hatter

Here Queen put spectacles began staring Hatter who turned pale fidgeted
Give your evidence said King dont nervous or Ill executed spot
This did not seem encourage witness all kept shifting from one foot other looking uneasily Queen confusion bit large piece out teacup instead bread butter
Just this moment Alice felt very curious sensation which puzzled good deal until made out what beginning grow larger again thought first would get up leave court but second thoughts decided remain where long there room for
wish wouldnt squeeze
said Dormouse who sitting next
can hardly breathe
cant help said Alice very meekly Im growing
Youve no right grow here said Dormouse
Dont talk nonsense said Alice more boldly know youre growing too
Yes but grow reasonable pace said Dormouse not that ridiculous fashion
And got up very sulkily crossed over other side court
All this time Queen never left off staring Hatter just Dormouse crossed court said one officers court Bring me list singers last concert which wretched Hatter trembled that shook both shoes off
Give your evidence King repeated angrily or Ill executed whether youre nervous or not

Well any rate Dormouse said Hatter went looking anxiously round see if would deny too but Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep
After that continued Hatter cut some more bread butter But what did Dormouse say one jury asked
That cant remember said Hatter
You must remember remarked King or Ill executed
miserable Hatter dropped teacup bread butter went down one knee
Im poor man your Majesty began
Youre very poor speaker said King
Here one guinea pigs cheered immediately suppressed by officers court
As that rather hard word will just explain how done
They large canvas bag which tied up mouth strings into this they slipped guinea pig head first then sat upon
Im glad Ive seen that done thought Alice
Ive often read newspapers end trials There some attempts applause which immediately suppressed by officers court never understood what meant till now
If thats all know about may stand down continued King

Then may sit down King replied
Here other guinea pig cheered suppressed
Come that finished guinea pigs thought Alice
Now we shall get better
Id rather finish my tea said Hatter an anxious look Queen who reading list singers
You may go said King Hatter hurriedly left court without even waiting put shoes
just take head off outside Queen added one officers but Hatter out sight before officer could get door
Call next witness said King
next witness Duchesss cook
carried pepper box hand Alice guessed who even before got into court by way people near door began sneezing all once
Give your evidence said King
Shant said cook
King looked anxiously White Rabbit who said low voice Your Majesty must cross examine this witness
Well if must must King said melancholy air after folding arms frowning cook till eyes were nearly out sight said deep voice What are tarts made Pepper mostly said cook
Treacle said sleepy voice behind
Collar that Dormouse Queen shrieked out
Behead that Dormouse Turn that Dormouse out court Suppress him Pinch him Off whiskers For some minutes whole court confusion getting Dormouse turned out by time they settled down again cook disappeared
Never mind said King an air great relief
Call next witness
And added an undertone Queen Really my dear must cross examine next witness
quite makes my forehead ache Alice watched White Rabbit fumbled over list feeling very curious see what next witness would like for they havent got much evidence yet said herself
Imagine surprise when White Rabbit read out top shrill little voice name Alice CHAPTER XII
Alices Evidence Here cried Alice quite forgetting flurry moment how large grown last few minutes jumped up such hurry that tipped over jury box edge skirt upsetting all jurymen heads crowd below there they lay sprawling about reminding very much globe goldfish accidentally upset week before
Oh beg your pardon exclaimed tone great dismay began picking them up again quickly could for accident goldfish kept running head vague sort idea that they must collected once put back into jury box or they would die
trial cannot proceed said King very grave voice until all jurymen are back their proper placesall repeated great emphasis looking hard Alice said
Alice looked jury box saw that haste put Lizard head downwards poor little thing waving its tail about melancholy way being quite unable move
soon got out again put right not that signifies much said herself should think would quite much use trial one way up other
As soon jury little recovered from shock being upset their slates pencils been found handed back them they set work very diligently write out history accident all except Lizard who seemed too much overcome do anything but sit its mouth open gazing up into roof court
What do know about this business King said Alice
Nothing said Alice
Nothing whatever persisted King
Nothing whatever said Alice
Thats very important King said turning jury
They were just beginning write this down their slates when White Rabbit interrupted Unimportant your Majesty means course said very respectful tone but frowning making faces him spoke
Unimportant course meant King hastily said went himself an undertone if were trying which word sounded best
Some jury wrote down important some unimportant
Alice could see this near enough look over their slates but doesnt matter bit thought herself
At this moment King who been for some time busily writing note book cackled out Silence read out from book Rule Forty two
All persons more than mile high leave court
Everybody looked Alice
Im not mile high said Alice
You are said King
Nearly two miles high added Queen
Well shant go any rate said Alice besides thats not regular rule invented just now
Its oldest rule book said King
Then ought Number One said Alice
King turned pale shut note book hastily
Consider your verdict said jury low trembling voice
Theres more evidence come yet please your Majesty said White Rabbit jumping up great hurry this paper has just been picked up
Whats said Queen

must been that said King unless written nobody which isnt usual know
Who directed said one jurymen
isnt directed all said White Rabbit fact theres nothing written outside
unfolded paper spoke added isnt letter after all its set verses
Are they prisoners handwriting asked another jurymen
No theyre not said White Rabbit thats queerest thing about
jury all looked puzzled
must imitated somebody elses hand said King
jury all brightened up again
Please your Majesty said Knave didnt write they cant prove did theres no name signed end
If didnt sign said King that only makes matter worse
You must meant some mischief or else youd signed your name like an honest man
There general clapping hands this first really clever thing King said that day
That proves guilt said Queen
proves nothing sort said Alice
Why dont even know what theyre about Read them said King
White Rabbit put spectacles
Where shall begin please your Majesty asked
Begin beginning King said gravely go till come end then stop
These were verses White Rabbit read They told me been And mentioned me him gave me good character But said could not swim
sent them word not gone We know true If should push matter What would become gave one they gave him two You gave us three or more They all returned from him Though they were mine before
If or should chance Involved this affair trusts set them free Exactly we were
My notion that been Before this fit An obstacle that came between Him ourselves
Dont let him know liked them best For this must ever A secret kept from all rest Between yourself me
Thats most important piece evidence weve heard yet said King rubbing hands now let jury If any one them can explain said Alice grown large last few minutes that wasnt bit afraid interrupting him Ill give him sixpence
dont believe theres an atom meaning
jury all wrote down their slates doesnt believe theres an atom meaning but none them attempted explain paper
If theres no meaning said King that saves world trouble know we neednt try find any
And yet dont know went spreading out verses knee looking them one eye seem see some meaning them after all
said could not swim cant swim can added turning Knave
Knave shook head sadly
Do look like said
Which certainly did not being made entirely cardboard
All right far said King went muttering over verses himself â€˜We know true thats jury courseâ€˜I gave one they gave him two why that must what did tarts know But goes â€˜they all returned from him said Alice
Why there they are said King triumphantly pointing tarts table
Nothing can clearer than that
Then againâ€˜before this fit never fits my dear think said Queen
Never said Queen furiously throwing an inkstand Lizard spoke
unfortunate little Bill left off writing slate one finger found made no mark but now hastily began again using ink that trickling down face long lasted
Then words dont fit said King looking round court smile
There dead silence
Its pun King added an offended tone everybody laughed Let jury consider their verdict King said for about twentieth time that day
No no said Queen
Sentence firstverdict afterwards
Stuff nonsense said Alice loudly
idea having sentence first Hold your tongue said Queen turning purple
wont said Alice
Off head Queen shouted top voice
Nobody moved
Who cares for said Alice grown full size by this time
Youre nothing but pack cards At this whole pack rose up into air came flying down upon gave little scream half fright half anger tried beat them off found herself lying bank head lap sister who gently brushing away some dead leaves that fluttered down from trees upon face
Wake up Alice dear said sister Why what long sleep youve Oh Ive such curious dream said Alice told sister well could remember them all these strange Adventures hers that just been reading about when finished sister kissed said curious dream dear certainly but now run your tea its getting late
So Alice got up ran off thinking while ran well might what wonderful dream been
But sister sat still just left leaning head hand watching setting sun thinking little Alice all wonderful Adventures till too began dreaming after fashion this dream First dreamed little Alice herself once again tiny hands were clasped upon knee bright eager eyes were looking up into hersshe could hear very tones voice see that queer little toss head keep back wandering hair that would always get into eyesand still listened or seemed listen whole place around became alive strange creatures little sisters dream
long grass rustled feet White Rabbit hurried bythe frightened Mouse splashed way through neighbouring poolshe could hear rattle teacups March Hare friends shared their never ending meal shrill voice Queen ordering off unfortunate guests executiononce more pig baby sneezing Duchesss knee while plates dishes crashed around itonce more shriek Gryphon squeaking Lizards slate pencil choking suppressed guinea pigs filled air mixed up distant sobs miserable Mock Turtle
So sat closed eyes half believed herself Wonderland though knew but open them again all would change dull realitythe grass would only rustling wind pool rippling waving reedsthe rattling teacups would change tinkling sheep bells Queens shrill cries voice shepherd boyand sneeze baby shriek Gryphon all other queer noises would change knew confused clamour busy farm yardwhile lowing cattle distance would take place Mock Turtles heavy sobs
Lastly pictured herself how this same little sister hers would after time herself grown woman how would keep through all riper years simple loving heart childhood how would gather about other little children make their eyes bright eager many strange tale perhaps even dream Wonderland long ago how would feel all their simple sorrows find pleasure all their simple joys remembering own child life happy summer days
